## Bulleted lists

You can create bulleted lists using `*`, `-`, or `+` at the start of each line.
Add two spaces before the bullet to create a nested list.

### What you type

```
* bulleted lists
  * with sub-bullets too
  * sub-bullets start with 2 spaces
    * start sub-sub-bullets with 4 spaces
* multi
line
bullet
- dashes and
+ pluses are ok too
```

## Numbered lists

You can create numbered lists by putting a number followed by a `.` at the start
of each line. Lists are numbered automatically, so you can reorder list items
while editing your message without having to update the numbers. Add two spaces
before the number to create a nested list.

### What you type

```
1. numbered lists
1. increment automatically
   1. use nested lists if you like
   3. delete or reorder lines without fixing the numbering
1. one more
   17. lists can start at any number
   18. so you can continue a list after some other text
```
