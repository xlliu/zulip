# Quote and reply

You can quote a previous message, either replying within a topic or to
start a new topic.

The first line of the reply contains a [permanent link][link-to-message]
to the quoted message. Zulip automatically turns mentions in the quoted text
into [silent mentions](/help/mention-a-user-or-group#silently-mention-a-user)
to avoid unnecessarily mentioning someone twice.

!!! tip ""

    You can use [quote blocks](/help/format-a-quote)
    when quoting emails or other non-Zulip content.
